# ✅ New ElevenLabs Agent Configured!

## What Just Happened

Your `.env.local` has been updated with the new agent ID:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=agent_7301kdns729jekx9yb13049rk519
```

## 🔄 RESTART REQUIRED

**You MUST restart your dev server for the changes to take effect:**

### In your terminal where `npm run dev` is running:

1. **Press `Ctrl+C`** to stop the server
2. **Run:** `npm run dev`
3. Wait for it to start

## 🧪 Testing

After restarting, test your new agent:

### Option 1: Diagnostic Page (Recommended)
```
http://localhost:3000/diagnostic
```
1. Click "Start Connection"
2. Speak: "Hello, I want to learn Spanish"
3. You should get a response!

### Option 2: Main App
```
http://localhost:3000/learn?lang=spanish&personality=friendly
```
1. Click "Join Call"
2. Start speaking
3. The AI should respond!

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you'll see:
```
✅ Connected to ElevenLabs
📨 Message received: { message: "Hello! ...", source: "ai" }
```

And you'll **hear the AI speaking back to you**!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still don't get responses after restarting:

1. **Test the agent directly on ElevenLabs:**
   - Your agent link: https://elevenlabs.io/app/talk-to?agent_id=agent_7301kdns729jekx9yb13049rk519
   - Does it work there?

2. **Check agent configuration:**
   - Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
   - Find your new agent
   - Make sure:
     - ✅ Status is "Published"
     - ✅ Has a system prompt
     - ✅ Has a voice selected

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12
   - Look for any red errors
   - Share them with me
