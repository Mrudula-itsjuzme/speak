# 🔍 Architecture Comparison & Issue Analysis

## Your Current Setup vs Reference Repo

### Reference Repo (git-ksupriya/MisSpoke)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) - `app.py`
- **AI Provider:** Agora Conversational AI
- **Video:** Agora RTC Video SDK
- **Architecture:** Traditional client-server
  - Frontend → FastAPI → Agora ConvAI → Response
  - Backend handles all AI communication
  - Token-based authentication

### Your Current Setup
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- **AI Providers:** 
  - **OpenRouter** (for prompt generation) ✅ Working
  - **ElevenLabs** (for voice conversation) ❌ Not responding
- **Architecture:** Serverless/Edge
  - Frontend → ElevenLabs WebSocket (direct)
  - Frontend → Next.js API → OpenRouter (for prompts)

## The Problem

Your app has **two separate systems**:

### System 1: Prompt Generation (✅ Working)
```
User loads page → Next.js API (/api/prompt) → OpenRouter → System Prompt
```
This is working perfectly with GPT-4o-mini!

### System 2: Voice Conversation (❌ Not Working)
```
User speaks → ElevenLabs WebSocket → ElevenLabs Agent → Response
```
This is where the problem is!

## Why Voice Isn't Working

The ElevenLabs agent needs to be configured with the system prompt. There are two ways to do this:

### Option A: Static Configuration (Recommended)
Configure the agent directly in ElevenLabs dashboard:
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find your agent (ID from `.env.local`)
3. Set the system prompt manually

### Option B: Dynamic Configuration (What your app tries)
Send the prompt when connecting - but this might not be supported by ElevenLabs' current API.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix ElevenLabs Configuration (Quick)

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Click on your agent
3. Update the "System Prompt" with language learning instructions
4. Make sure agent is "Published" (not Draft)
5. Test directly on ElevenLabs website
6. If it works there, it should work in your app

**Pros:** Quick fix, no code changes
**Cons:** Can't dynamically change personality/language

### Option 2: Add Backend Like Reference Repo (Complex)

Create a FastAPI backend that:
- Handles the conversation logic
- Manages the AI provider (could keep using OpenRouter)
- Provides WebSocket for real-time voice
- Gives you full control

**Pros:** Full control, can switch AI providers easily
**Cons:** Significant architecture change

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Keep your current Next.js setup but add an API route that:
- Updates the ElevenLabs agent configuration dynamically
- Or switches to a different voice AI provider that supports dynamic prompts

## Immediate Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Test ElevenLabs Agent Directly

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find your agent
3. Click "Test" or "Try it"
4. Speak to it
5. **Does it respond?**
   - ✅ Yes → Agent works, issue is in your app's integration
   - ❌ No → Agent itself is broken, needs configuration

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

Open your app and check console for:
```javascript
// Good signs:
"Connected to ElevenLabs" ✅
"Message: { message: '...', source: 'ai' }" ✅

// Bad signs:
"ElevenLabs error: ..." ❌
"WebSocket connection failed" ❌
No messages at all when you speak ❌
```

### Step 3: Check Network Tab

1. Open DevTools → Network → WS (WebSocket filter)
2. Click "Join Call"
3. Look for WebSocket connection
4. Click on it to see messages
5. When you speak, you should see messages being sent/received
