# 🚨 ElevenLabs Agent Issue Diagnosed

## What's Happening

Your logs show:
```
✅ Connected to ElevenLabs
✅ Session started
❌ Disconnected from ElevenLabs (immediately after)
```

This means:
- ✅ Your API key works
- ✅ The agent ID exists
- ❌ **The agent is rejecting the connection or has an error**

## Most Likely Causes

### 1. Agent is in "Draft" Mode (Most Common)
The agent exists but isn't published yet.

**Fix:**
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find agent: `agent_4901kd0w9azbfxt99wzjf6jfpdef`
3. Look for status - is it "Draft"?
4. Click "Publish" button
5. Try connecting again

### 2. Agent Has No System Prompt
The agent is published but has no instructions.

**Fix:**
1. Click on the agent
2. Add this to "System Prompt":
```
You are a friendly language tutor. Help users practice languages through conversation. Keep responses short (1-3 sentences). Be encouraging and patient.
```
3. Click "Save"
4. Try connecting again

### 3. Agent Has No Voice Selected
The agent needs a voice to speak.

**Fix:**
1. Click on the agent
2. Go to "Voice" settings
3. Select any voice (try "Rachel" or "Adam")
4. Click "Save"
5. Try connecting again

### 4. ElevenLabs Account Issue
Your account might have quota/billing issues.

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/usage
2. Check if you have available credits/quota
3. If not, you may need to upgrade or wait for quota reset

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Test Agent Directly on ElevenLabs

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Find your agent: `agent_4901kd0w9azbfxt99wzjf6jfpdef`
3. Click the "Test" or "Try" button
4. **Speak to it directly on their website**

**Result:**
- ✅ **If it works:** The agent is fine, issue is with your app integration
- ❌ **If it doesn't work:** The agent needs configuration (see fixes above)

### Step 2: Check Agent Status

On the ElevenLabs dashboard, look for:
- Status: Should be "Published" (not "Draft")
- Voice: Should have a voice selected
- System Prompt: Should have instructions
- Model: Should have a model selected

### Step 3: Create a Fresh Agent (If Nothing Works)

If the current agent is broken beyond repair:

1. Click "Create New Agent"
2. Name: "Language Tutor Test"
3. System Prompt:
```
You are a helpful language tutor. Respond briefly and encouragingly.
```
4. Voice: Select any voice
5. Model: Use default
6. Click "Publish"
7. **Copy the new Agent ID**
8. Update `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=new_agent_id_here
```
9. Restart dev server

## Alternative Solution: Switch to OpenAI Realtime API

Since you already have OpenRouter working, we could switch from ElevenLabs to OpenAI's Realtime API for voice:

**Pros:**
- Uses the same OpenRouter/OpenAI ecosystem
- More reliable
- Better integration with text-based AI

**Cons:**
- Requires code changes
- Different API structure

Would you like me to implement this if ElevenLabs continues to have issues?

## Immediate Action

**Right now, please do this:**

1. **Go to:** https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai

2. **Find agent:** `agent_4901kd0w9azbfxt99wzjf6jfpdef`

3. **Check these boxes:**
   - [ ] Is status "Published"? (not Draft)
   - [ ] Does it have a voice selected?
   - [ ] Does it have a system prompt?
   - [ ] Can you test it on the ElevenLabs website?

4. **Tell me what you find!**

## If Agent Works on ElevenLabs Website

If the agent works when you test it directly on ElevenLabs but not in your app, then we have an integration issue. In that case, we'll need to:

1. Check the `@11labs/react` package version
2. Update the conversation hook configuration
3. Add better error handling

But first, let's confirm the agent itself works!

**Next Step:** Go to ElevenLabs dashboard and check the agent status. Let me know what you see!
